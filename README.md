# treehouse_u5_cli_introduction
I am maintaining this as a way to show my work through github as team treehouse uses an internal monitor for progress instead of commits.

I feel like this may have been way more effective if it was done prior to any actual coding. Learning to use a computer as a developer would seem to supersede everything else as the initial building block. Second to this, I would assume that learning to use an IDE would make more sense than doing it in a virtual workspace. A) It cuts down on infrastructure for the school. B) It teaches us to work in a more real world setting.
